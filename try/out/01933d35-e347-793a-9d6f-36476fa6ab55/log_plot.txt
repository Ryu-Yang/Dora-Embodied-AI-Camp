    ⚠ The version of the Rerun Viewer available on your PATH does not match the version of your Rerun SDK ⚠

    Rerun does not make any kind of backwards/forwards compatibility guarantee yet: this can lead to (subtle) bugs.

    > Rerun Viewer: v0.15.1 (executable: "rerun")
    > Rerun SDK: v0.19.1

    You can install an appropriate version of the Rerun Viewer via binary releases:
    * Using `cargo`: `cargo binstall --force rerun-cli@0.19.1` (see https://github.com/cargo-bins/cargo-binstall)
    * Via direct download from our release assets: https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/releases/0.19.1/
    * Using `pip`: `pip3 install rerun-sdk==0.19.1`

    For more information, refer to our complete install documentation over at:
